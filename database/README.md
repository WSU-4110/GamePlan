# Database Setup (For Later)

This folder is for future database work. For now, the website works with sample data in the JavaScript.

## When We Add the Database

The database will store:
- Code examples
- User accounts
- Categories and tags
- Ratings and comments

## For Backend Devq

When you're ready to work on the database:
1. Use MYSQL
2. Create tables for users, code_examples, categories, etc.
3. Connect it to a simple backend API

## Current Status

Right now, everything works with sample data in `js/script.js`. This lets frontend developers work without needing a database.

When the backend is ready, we'll:
1. Replace sample data with real API calls
2. Add user authentication
3. Add the ability to upload and manage code examples
