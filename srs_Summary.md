This file was created to summarize parts of our Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for Assignment 2.



the highlights
Met as a group to sync on scope, roles, and priorities.

Wrote the functional and non-functional requirements so we’re aligned on what the system does and how it should perform.

Set initial UI design goals focused on clarity, consistency, and quick navigation.

we meet and decide together, and document the decisions in plain language.

Everyone gets a say; if something changes, we revisit it as a group.

We keep the SRS “live” so it reflects what we actually agreed to build.

Turn UI goals into quick sketches/wireframes and review them in the next meeting.
